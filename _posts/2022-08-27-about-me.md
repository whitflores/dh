Hi, I’m Whit, my pronouns are they/them, and I’m a Communication major currently debating between minors because of this class. The first two classes with Dr. Stover made me realize I misunderstood the Digital Humanities completely. I looked at the department's pamphlet, catalog pages, and the CNU website last year, but I didn’t get it. Now, I realize it is _**precisely**_ what I want to do with my career.

I love writing, as I said, but I am also a visual artist and enjoy organizing information. _(I’m not sure how I missed it either.)_

Web design has interested me for a long time, ever since I started my first blog in fourth grade. It’s a long story, but basically I wrote a lot of poetry one summer and wanted a way to share it with my family, namely my grandparents.

That first blog was made with Blogger. Since then, I have used other platforms to create more websites, for myself and others. I have always been too intimidated to get very far with coding.  I am excited to learn more about GitHub with this class. I am also taking CPSC 140 this semester, which is “Introduction to Computer Programming with Multimedia.”

I work in the Writing Center _(we open next week–you can meet face to face, over Google Meet, or have your work, personal or professional, peer reviewed asynchronously)_. I also teach ESOL to adults in the community. 

This past summer, I worked as an intern in the communication department of a boarding school. I interviewed people for features and wrote for their magazine and annual report, as well as updated the website. It was a great learning experience.

It was the kind of work I’m interested in doing, essentially the communications for organizations. I’ve always thought I would go to graduate school directly after college, but now that I’m here, I think I might wait. I hope to get a job in this area or the state capital. Really, I just want to live in a city. It may seem like a broad stroke, but it’s what you get when you grow up in the middle of nowhere.

I hope this class teaches us ways to make the world more accessible. I know it isn’t the point of the course. But in my opinion, increasing accessibility is one of the most meaningful things we can do with technology. From alt-text, to screen readers, to websites that are translatable to other languages, to multimedia engaging different kinds of thinkers, to information being in reach at all because it’s on the Internet, is incredible. I would be really interested in talking about this issue in the context of DH. Making the humanities, something I value highly, accessible to the most people possible is a dream.

Other dreams of mine include publishing my novels _(just one would be enough, I’m not greedy)_, attending a Taylor Swift Secret Sessions, and paying off my student loans.

To me, digital humanities looks like the logical extension of my communication studies. I am excited to see where it goes. 

_Thanks for reading. I look forward to working with you in this class!_
