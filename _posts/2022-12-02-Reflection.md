I had no idea what I was getting myself into when I signed up for ENGL 350: Writing for the Digital Humanities. Perhaps I thought I did, but I was wrong.

# What is DH?
We began the class by exploring definitions of the digital humanities (DH). One of the first days, I took a gander at writing my own definition in my notes. Looking back, I stand by it, not as a definition per say, but as a highlighting of what I believe is critical about HD.

> The Digital Humanities synthesizes humanities and tech into something neither could achieve alone.
 
It is the _compounding_ of humanities and tech that is so incredible, to me.

I found two definitions out of the many I read from [whatisdigitalhumanities.com](https://whatisdigitalhumanities.com/) particularly helpful. There are so many (correct) ways to understand the field that reading as many as I did was crucial to my understanding of just how wide the scope is.

> Digital Humanities is the combination of using digital techniques to better understand and present our understanding of the Humanities. It is about the dissemination of our work, the sharing of knowledge and collaborating to give the best possible chance to a project. Digital Humanities is about the Community, about learning, constantly evolving and being open to new ways of thinking about old questions. It is not, as a friend asked, about building digital humans.

Examples of DH projects from lectures also helped me form an idea of what DH is. For example, we discussed how “a website for a fender for the arts” is not DH, but a virtual tour of a museum _can_ be if they heavily rely on technology, like a 3D rendering of Colonial Williamsburg.

# Readings
The readings helped, too. All of the readings for the class supported my understanding of the course content. They fit very well with the lectures and assignments for me. 

I’d like to highlight a few that really stood out to me.

* Nielson Norman Group, “[Text Scanning Patterns: Eyetracking Evidence](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/text-scanning-patterns-eyetracking/)”
* Katherine Hepworth and Christopher Church, “[Racism in the Machine: Visualization Ethics in Digital Humanities Projects](http://www.digitalhumanities.org/dhq/vol/12/4/000408/000408.html)”

Both of these articles blew my mind and changed the way I thought about text.

**About DH projects, which we read when we were planning our own project for our grant:**
* Alok Amatya, “[For Beginners, What Makes a Good DH Project?](https://www.hastac.org/blogs/alok/2017/09/22/beginners-what-makes-good-dh-project)”
* [Visualizing Objects, Places, and Spaces: A Digital Project Handbook](https://handbook.pubpub.org/tools)

**About grant writing:**
* Ellen W. Gorsevski, “How Can I Make My Grant Proposal Stand Out From All the Others” from _Writing Successful Grant Proposals_
* Robert Porter, “Why Academics Have a Hard Time Writing Good Grant Proposals”

The course content offered a multitude of ways to understand DH in all of its complexities. A combination of the readings, lectures, group discussions, assignments, projects, and DH we observed and reviewed did this. I look at two DH projects closely for my reviews: [The Digitial Aponte](LINK) and [The Bombsight Project](LINK). They both captivated my interest in subject (humanities) and form (technology). Seeing existing DH projects was really key to my understanding of DH. It also made it more than theory and brought the ideas of the field to life.

# The Grant
Ah, the grant. What a beautiful project.

I plan to apply for the URCA grant next fall with Dr. Stover as my advisor. Having the opportunity to go through with my project has become a dream of mine this semester. The project felt far away when I started, but after my research, writing, and rewriting of the grant proposal, it feels really possible and _needed_.

So yeah, I’d say I’ve grown as a digital humanist. I went from not realizing I wanted to be one to starting the process of becoming one in fifteen short weeks.
