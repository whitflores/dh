# Project Overview

![Bomb Sight project map](URL)

The Bomb Sight project illustrates the London Blitz. The Blitz was an “intense bombing campaign” employed by Nazi Germany on the United Kingdom during World War II [Britannica](https://www.britannica.com/event/the-Blitz). This project focuses on bombs dropped over London between July 10th, 1940 and June 6th, 1941. The map is supported and contextualized with local photographs from the time, as well as “memories” or first-hand accounts from survivors. 

The Bomb Sight project made information about the London Blitz that was previously exclusively available to guests of the National Archives, located in London, accessible to the public. The content is meant to be explored by academic scholars and anyone else with an interest in the history of the London Blitz. 

# Humanistic Claims
This project rests in historical studies. There is clearly a specific scope of information. That being said, it does not simply list numbers and places for a reader to shift through. The project, altogether, functions to give viewers the opportunity to do a deep dive into the history. Through the maps, statistics, images, and stories, a reader can put together a comprehensive understanding of the event. I found the project to be user-friendly and easily navigable. By being online, free, and friendly to non-scholars, the project brings more people into the conversation of the history of the London Blitz.

# Technology
The technology used and featured in this project made it comprehensive and easy to navigate as a user. Links and images were clearly labeled as clickable. The map had usage instructions (see “Information” button at header), which included a brief explanation of the purpose of the map, instructions of “How to use the Map,” as well as what information is available in the map.

## User-Friendly
Overall, the simplicity of the front-facing side of the project face made it incredibly user-friendly. The given explanations of the project’s process, namely data collection and map selection, was clear, brief, and understandable to someone unfamiliar with the history and GIS. The “FAQ” page describes the methods of their research and data collection, overall, simplifying a very complex process to make it available for a broader audience. Additionally, they have an annotated bibliography (Data>Data Sources, “Index of Data Sources”) that makes it possible to understand their sources without prior knowledge. 

## Accessibility
I paid close attention to the accessibility of this project’s map, especially for low vision users. The main reason for this is the focus on accessibility my grant project requires. The visuals stood out to me and are my only real critique of the project.

To begin, the “Street Map View” of the map, as opposed to the “Satellite View,” has very low contrast between colors of the map and text. For this review, I will focus on the contrast of the text on various backgrounds in the map on “Street Map View” with both “Anti-Invasion Sites” and “Bomb Incidents” showing (see the square icon in top right-hand corner of the map for these options).

I spent some time putting the color values into an online color contrast checker which quantifies how visible one color is next to another. The minimum standard of the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG)  is 4.5:1 for regular-size text. For more information on this standard, see the [Contrast Checker](https://webaim.org/resources/contrastchecker/) I used from WebAIM.

The text of the street names is light-gray on white streets, sometimes overlapping the dark-gray street outline. These colors in addition to the small font and non-linear positions, makes the street names difficult to read. The text of street names have a ratio of 1.51 to the street and 1.17 against the outlines, which fails the WCAG test.

Text bubbles of information appear when you click on a single bomb. They each start with the titile “High-Explosive Bomb,” list the address it was “recorded close to,” and end with a link to “Read More.” This link takes a user to a page with details, images, and “memories” at the site or nearby. This is an excellent connection. It could, however, be clearer visually.

The title is slightly larger than the main text in the bubble and bolded. The dark-gray color against the white background earns a high, passing, score of 8.71. The text fails at 1.87, as does the link. For comparison, the blue typically used for link, against a white background, has a ratio of 9.4.

![Bomb Sight map text bubble](https://dsm01pap002files.storage.live.com/y4mzopDX81FTvMLWRpSQoDRVS4PAHeOzfjtY6MdR6gbNrAlYKJ91yb7nTSsLjpiKmpsxaRL99hLthETsnFw7_j6Xplc8jEl6o2Vpu7J5SCVtgYUuG-K36zxzUO-NN-aAFgVhuynkpX6VJhAPnyLGKqru5kH1EyvZ1Y7KNPSEu3XLpXtZwG2FQQm_NQtRZOQ7rwC?width=503&height=262&cropmode=none)

One reason for the color choices may be out of a desire to not distract people from the bomb sights, which makes sense to me. However, I think it would be worthwhile to increase the contrast to make it accessible to even more people. I wouldn’t want a lack of color contrast to keep an 80-year-old who survived the London Blitz from accessing a project about the Blitz.

One contrast the project does brilliantly is the bright red circle to notate the location of the bombs. I mean this sincerely, they are clearly labeled and as the most important part of the map, they should be. This is especially helpful if the map is viewed with “Satellite View” as the map becomes darker and crowded with visual details. 

These design decisions could be remedied with some color changes. I think it is especially important that the text be clear.

The rest of the project is largely text, which all passes the WCAG test. It is also in a larger font. Images expand when clicked. Both of these things are important for accessibility.

I do not expect the project to be 100% accessible to low-vision users. I appreciate how much effort the project team put in to make the information available and accessible to the public. 

## Media
The maps and images took this project from something potentially imaginable from text to a visual form that transports the user to the time and place. 

One unexpectedly impactful image I came across was the one shown at the beginning of this review and below.

![Historic image relating to the ward of Tachbrook](URL)
Image Caption: “Southwest London Garage Shelter, Pimlico: A group of Londoners play a game of cards to pass the time.”

At the bottom of the list of boroughs of the Greater London area on the “Explore London” page, there is a ward called Tachbrook. It has four images of people in the Southwest London Garage Shelter. Many of the related images, including the other three from this ward, are harrowing. They show people bundled in blankets and despair on the streets of the city. This image disrupts this pattern with a flash of normalcy. A reminder that no matter how dire the situation, people always come together to create entertainment and connection.

No amount of text would have given me as powerful a sense of that connection as that single image. Thus, I argue this project adds depth to the research of this era. The combination of numerical data visualized on maps and personal stories and images from the time allow for a true understanding of what it must have been like.

## Augmented Reality Android App (Discontinued)
The project team created an Android App that used Augmented Reality to let users “explore where the bombs fell as you walk around the streets of London.” I cannot speak to it as the app is no longer available. If you are interested in seeing what it might have been, you can watch the [video preview](https://youtu.be/O_devspe9yA)  the project team made in 2012.

# Inspiration to My Project
The project I am proposing is also a mapping project. I have known I might wish to add information in addition to the map, and the Bomb Sight project inspired me on one way I might do so.

My proposal is to map the accessibility of CNU’s campus. If I moved forward with the project, I would start small. However, I want to plan for the possibility of success, and for more information to follow the initial batch. For example, I could start by mapping paths, doors, and ramps. There are so many more features of campus that disabled students need to know. Having different layers with different information could keep the map from getting too cluttered. 

While the Bomb Sight project of 1940-41 London may appear very different from my project of present-day Christopher Newport University, both share a purpose at their cores: they tell a story of their space and time.
