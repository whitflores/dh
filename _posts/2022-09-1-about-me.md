# **Why I Am Here, In the Digital Humanities**

Hi, I’m Whit, my pronouns are they/them/theirs, and I am a writer. I am also a Communication major currently debating minors because of this Digital Humanities (DH) class. 

The communication aspect of DH is what interests me most, but I also enjoy organizing information and working with technology in regards to design. 

Without this class and Dr. Stover, I may have never discovered DH or that it is exactly what I want to do with my work.

## **_Organization_**
The possibilities of organization is what first attracted me to the DH field, specifically one paragraph from the fourth assigned reading.

In [_Digital_ _Humanities_, Anne Burdick, Jeffrey Schnapp, and Johanna Drucke (2012)](https://archive.org/details/DigitalHumanities_201701/mode/2up) explore the question:

“_How does the Digital Humanities function in the print-plus era?_”

It may seem obvious that with print, we, as humans, are limited. 

“_Print typically offers a single viewing angle, **linear organization**, a research output characterized by finitude and stability, and a scale of documentation and argumentation that has to respect the physical proportions of the book_.”

But have you ever really thought about the kinds of organization possible with technology? I am talking about layers and multiple viewpoints and **non-linear flows of information**.

It, “_allows for toggling back and forth between multiple view of the same materials… for multilinear views of argument… [it allows a] seemingly unlimited scale_.” 

One of my favorite parts of organizing information in a variety of ways is that it can make it more accessible to people who think “differently.” 

## **_Technology_**

Web design has interested me for a long time, ever since I started my first blog in fourth grade. It’s a long story, but basically, I wrote a lot of poetry one summer and wanted a way to share it with my family, namely my grandparents.

That first blog was made with Blogger. Since then, I have used other platforms to create more websites, for myself and others. I have always been too intimidated to get very far with coding.  I am excited to learn more about GitHub with this class. 

I am also taking CPSC 140 this semester, which is “Introduction to Computer Programming with Multimedia.” I want to get a foundation of knowledge in coding, enough so that I can learn more with websites like GitHub.

# **My Work**

I work in the university’s Writing Center as a peer tutor. I love writing and talking about writing, and I truly believe the service helps students.

I also teach English to speakers of other languages (ESOL). I started working with adults in the community last February when I had the opportunity to take a class about teaching ESOL. 

It has long been something close to my heart, as my dad speaks English as a second language. I grew up learning alongside him, helping him, and learning about the opportunities and challenges of living in the U.S. as an English language learner.

This past summer, I worked as an intern in the communication department of a boarding school. I interviewed people for features and wrote for their magazine and annual report, as well as updated the website. It was a great learning experience. 

For example, I learned that working in communications for organizations is what I want to do in my career. 

I hope to get a job on the peninsula or the state capital. Really, I just want to live in a city. It may seem like a broad stroke, but it’s what you get when you grow up in a town that is in the middle of nowhere.

# **My Dreams (For This Class and Beyond)**

I hope this class teaches us ways to make the world more accessible. I know it isn’t the point of the course, but it is my opinion that increasing accessibility is one of the most meaningful things we can do with technology. 

From alt-text, to screen readers, to websites that are translatable to other languages, to multimedia engaging different kinds of thinkers, to information being in reach at all because it’s on the Internet–it’s _incredible_. 

To me, DH is the logical extension of my communication studies. I am excited to see where it goes. 

Making the humanities, something I value highly, accessible to the most people possible is a dream.

Other dreams of mine include publishing my novels _(just one would be enough, I’m not greedy)_, attending a Taylor Swift Secret Session, and paying off my student loans.
