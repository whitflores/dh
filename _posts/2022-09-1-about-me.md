Hi, I’m Whit, my pronouns are they/them/theirs, and I am a writer.

#**Why I Am Here, In the Digital Humanities**
I am a Communication major currently debating minors because of Dr. Stover’s Writing for the Digital Humanities (DH) class. 

Within the first two classes, she helped me realize I misunderstood the field of DH completely. I looked at the department's pamphlet, catalog pages, and the university’s website last year, but I didn’t understand. Now, I realize it is precisely what I want to do with my career.

DH is hard to define, something I believe makes it a field that will never stop growing. 

The communication aspect is what interests me most. In this post, I will share some of the reasons I value communication so highly, from my experience growing up bilingual and multicultural to my identity as a disabled person.

I love writing, as I said, but I am also a visual artist and enjoy organizing information. 

##**_Organization_**
The possibilities of organization is what first attracted me to the field, and what made me realize I was wrong about it. In their book, [Digital_Humanities, Anne Burdick, Jeffrey Schnapp, and Johanna Drucke (2012)](https://archive.org/details/DigitalHumanities_201701/mode/2up) explore the question:

“_How does the Digital Humanities function in the print-plus era?_”

It may seem obvious that with print, we are limited. 

“_Print typically offers a single viewing angle, linear organization, a research output characterized by finitude and stability, and a scale of documentation and argumentation that has to respect the physical proportions of the book_.”

But have you ever really thought about how much we can do with technology? I am talking about layers and multiple viewpoints and non-linear flows of information

It, “_allows for toggling back and forth between multiple view of the same materials… for fluid scale shifts, for ‘zooming’ from the macro- to the micro-level, and for the interweaving of data sets… for the faceting, filtering, and versioning of corpora; for the coexistence of multiple pathways within a single repository; for multilinear views of argument… [it allows a] seemingly unlimited scale and of being process- rather than product-based… [and] can have multiple lives on multiple platforms, with multiple authors_.” 

If I lost you with all the talk of organizing, I understand. It’s okay if it is not your thing. It is definitely mine. 

I share it because I think it helps paint a picture of who I am.

One of my favorite parts of organizing information in a variety of ways is that it can make it more accessible to people who think “differently.” I am one of those people, supposedly. 

##**_Technology_**
Web design has interested me for a long time, ever since I started my first blog in fourth grade. It’s a long story, but basically I wrote a lot of poetry one summer and wanted a way to share it with my family, namely my grandparents.

That first blog was made with Blogger. Since then, I have used other platforms to create more websites, for myself and others. I have always been too intimidated to get very far with coding.  I am excited to learn more about GitHub with this class. 

I am also taking CPSC 140 this semester, which is “Introduction to Computer Programming with Multimedia.” I want to get a foundation of knowledge in coding, enough so that I can learn more with websites like GitHub.

#**Work: Now and in the Future (Hopefully)**
I work in the university’s Writing Center as a peer tutor. I love writing and talking about writing, and I truly believe we help students. If you are interested, we open next week–_you can meet face to face, over Google Meet, or have your work, personal or professional, peer reviewed asynchronously)_. 

I also teach English to speakers of other languages (ESOL). I started working with adults in the community last February when I had the opportunity to take a class about teaching ESOL. 

It has long been something close to my heart as my dad speaks English as a second language. I grew up learning alongside him, helping him, and learning about the opportunities and challenges of living in the U.S. as an English language learner.

This past summer, I worked as an intern in the communication department of a boarding school. I interviewed people for features and wrote for their magazine and annual report, as well as updated the website. It was a great learning experience.

It was the kind of work I’m interested in doing, essentially the communications for organizations. I’ve always thought I would go to graduate school directly after college, but now that I’m here, I think I might wait. 

I hope to get a job in this area or the state capital. Really, I just want to live in a city. It may seem like a broad stroke, but it’s what you get when you grow up in a town I would describe as _in the middle of nowhere_.

_(Not my photo)_ It’s got nice views, at least. 

I hope this class teaches us ways to make the world more accessible. I know it isn’t the point of the course. But in my opinion, increasing accessibility is one of the most meaningful things we can do with technology. 

From alt-text, to screen readers, to websites that are translatable to other languages, to multimedia engaging different kinds of thinkers, to information being in reach at all because it’s on the Internet–it’s incredible. 

I would be really interested in talking about this issue in the context of DH. Making the humanities, something I value highly, accessible to the most people possible is a dream.

Other dreams of mine include publishing my novels _(just one would be enough, I’m not greedy)_, attending a Taylor Swift Secret Session, and paying off my student loans.

To me, DH is the logical extension of my communication studies. I am excited to see where it goes. 

_Thanks for reading._
